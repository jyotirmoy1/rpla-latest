                               <p style="font-family: Adriatic_light; letter-spacing: 0.102em; font-weight: bolder; text-align: justify;">The domestic tax laws of India pertaining to tax on &lsquo;income&rsquo; are contained in the Income-tax Act, 1961 (&lsquo;Act&rsquo;). The definition of the word &lsquo;income&rsquo; as contained in section 2(24) of the Act is an inclusive one and it does not precisely define as to what exactly is meant by &lsquo;income&rsquo;. There have been various landmark judicial precedents on the point as to what is meant by &lsquo;income&rsquo;, &lsquo;revenue receipts&rsquo; and &lsquo;capital receipts&rsquo;. <br /><br /> The definition of the word &lsquo;income&rsquo; in section 2(24) of the Act, being an inclusive definition, includes items which are purely in the nature of income, items on which there were issues as to whether the same constitute income or not and the legislature thought it appropriate to levy income-tax on the same (for example, capital gains), and capital receipts which the legislature deliberately included in the definition of income (for example, gifts received). In other words, wherever the legislature intended to levy income-tax on capital receipts or gains or something which is not in the nature of income, the legislature expanded the definition of the word &lsquo;income&rsquo; in section 2(24) of the Act to deem the same as income, and introduced separate provisions regarding charge and computation thereof in detail.<br /><br /> One such provision is the levy of tax in the hands of recipient of gifts etc. The provision was first introduced in the year 2004 by inserting section 56(2)(v). The scope of the same was expanded over the years multiple times by inserting section 56(2)(vi), 56(2)(vii) and 56(2)(viia), and the present provision is contained in section 56(2)(x) of the Act. Consequently, section 2(24) of the Act has also been amended to include in the income &lsquo;any sum of money or value of property referred to in section 56(2)(x)&rsquo;.<br /><br /> <u>How section 56(2)(x) of the Act works:</u><br /><br /> Section 56(2)(x) of the Act levies tax in the hands of recipient of sum of money, immovable property or movable property where the same are received either without consideration or for inadequate consideration, subject to a de minimums exemption of INR 50,000 and subject to details given in the section. The provisions of section 56(2)(x) of the Act are not applicable in certain cases, for example, where these are received from specified relatives or qualified merges or demergers etc.<br /><br /> While there are various debatable issues concerning section 56(2)(x) and earlier sections 56(2)(v)/(vi)/(vii)/(viia), the focus of this write up is regarding subscription by an investor in unlisted convertible instruments like compulsorily convertible preference shares (&lsquo;CCPS&rsquo;) and compulsorily convertible debentures (&lsquo;CCDs&rsquo;), and receipt of shares, whether listed or unlisted, from the company upon conversion. The discussion proceeds on the assumption that specified exemptions are not applicable.<br /><br /> Section 56(2)(x) of the Act, so far as it pertains to movable property being shares and securities, provides that where any person &lsquo;receives&rsquo; such property for a consideration which is less than the fair market value, then, the excess of fair market value over the consideration is taxable as income of the recipient. The fair market value for this purpose means the fair market value as determined in accordance with Rule 11UA (&lsquo;Tax FMV&rsquo;) on the date of &lsquo;receipt&rsquo; of shares or securities. There are separate sub-rules in Rule 11UA for unlisted equity shares and other unlisted shares which broadly provide for the following basis:<br /><br /> (a) Listed shares and securities<br /><br /> Where listed shares and securities are received by way of transaction on a recognized stock exchange, then, the transaction value shall be the Tax FMV. In other cases, the Tax FMV shall be:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lowest price of such shares and securities quoted on any recognized stock exchange on the valuation date, and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lowest price of such shares and securities on any recognized stock exchange on a date immediately preceding the valuation date when such shares and securities were traded on such stock exchange, in cases where on the valuation date there is no trading in such shares and securities on any recognized stock exchange.</p>
<p style="font-family: Adriatic_light; letter-spacing: 0.102em; font-weight: bolder; text-align: justify;"><br /> (b) Unlisted equity shares:<br /><br /> Value computed on the basis of book values of assets and liabilities of the company, on the valuation date, in prescribed manner. However, for a few assets of the company, like immovable property and shares and securities of other company etc., the book values are substituted by Tax FMV of the said assets. This is rather straight forward process based on numbers and there are no subjective issues or considerations which are there if shares were to be value on the basis of methods like DCF method. However, it is relevant to note that such value is required to be computed on the valuation date, that is, the date on which the shares are received which may pose practical difficulties which would need to be planned and addressed.<br /><br /> (c) Other unlisted securities:<br /><br /> Value, on the valuation date, as determined by a Category I merchant banker or a chartered accountant.<br /><br /> <u>Whether primary issuance of shares and securities is covered by section 56(2)(x):</u><br /> Section 56(2)(x) of the Act, as also the earlier provisions contained in section 56(2)(v)/(vi)/(vii)/(viia) of the Act, use the word &lsquo;receives&rsquo;, which on a plain reading may indicate that as far as investor is concerned, upon allotment it will &lsquo;receive&rsquo; the shares or securities.<br /><br /> An argument is being taken that these provisions should apply, in line with legislative intent, only where the existing shares or securities are transferred (i.e. secondary transactions) and not where such shares or securities are created by way of allotment (i.e. primary transactions). The argument is based largely on the basis of principles enunciated by the hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court&rsquo;s judgment in the case of Khoday Distillaries Ltd vs. CIT (2008) 76 CCH 1256 ISCC read with earlier judicial precedents. Khoday&rsquo;s case was in the context of deemed gift under section 4(1)(a) of the Gift Tax Act, 1958. Section 4(1)(a) of the Gift Tax Act, 1958 provided that where property is &lsquo;transferred&rsquo; otherwise than for adequate consideration, then, the excess of the value of the property over the value of the consideration is deemed to be a gift made by the &lsquo;transferor&rsquo;.<br /><br /> In Khoday&rsquo;s case, there was a rights issue by the company which was not subscribed to by 20 out of 27 shareholders and the shares to which the said 20 shareholders were entitled to, were allotted to 7 investment companies which were existing shareholders of the company. The assessing officer sought to levy gift tax on the excess of value of shares over issue price as deemed gift under section 4(1)(a) of the Gift Tax Act, 1958 in the hands of the company. It is on these facts that the hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court held that there is a vital difference between creation and transfer of shares and when shares are issued to a shareholder it is a case of creation of shares. The hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court, accordingly, held that when the company allotted the shares to the above referred 7 investment companies, it was not a case of &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; of shares, and thus the provisions of deemed gift contained in section 4(1)(a) will not be applicable.<br /><br /> In the context of section 56(2)(x) of the Act, it is relevant to note that the income is deemed in the hands of the person &lsquo;receiving&rsquo; the property and not in the hands of the issuer company. Further, the express language used in section 56(2)(x) of the Act does not require that such &lsquo;receipt&rsquo; by the investor should be only by way of &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; of existing shares or securities. Thus, any argument that at the point of time when the shares or securities are allotted it was not an existing property and there is no &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; thereof, and thus, should not be covered by the provisions of section 56(2)(x) of the Act, will be highly contentious.<br /><br /> In fact, Mumbai Tribunal 1 has rejected the argument and held that receipt of shares by primary issuance are squarely covered by the provisions of section 56(2)(vii) of the Act. Further, the position of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (&lsquo;CBDT&rsquo;), based on three circulars 2 issued by it, also clearly seem to be of the view that primary issuance of shares and securities is covered by these provisions.<br /><br /> Given the above, while it will be interesting to see how the evolves on this point, from a planning perspective, it may be prudent to proceed on the basis that the primary issuance of shares and securities is covered by the provisions of section 56(2)(x) of the Act.<br /><br /> <u> Allotment of CCPS and CCDs:</u><br /><br /> In view of the above discussion, when an investor is allotted CCPS or CCDs, the provisions of section 56(2)(x) of the Act may be triggered. In other words, one would need to get a determination of Tax FMV of the CCPS or DDCs, as the case may be, on the date of allotment, from a Category I merchant banker or a chartered accountant. If the Tax FMV of CCPS or CCDs so arrived at is more than the issue price (i.e. par value and premium, if any), then, the excess of Tax FMV over the issue price will become income of the investor under section 56(2)(x) of the Act. In such a case, the Tax FMV shall be deemed as the cost of acquisition of such CCPS or CCDs for capital gains tax purposes.<br /><br /> <u>Conversion of CCPS and CCDs:</u><br /><br /> Conversion of CCPS and CCDs into equity shares is not regarded as &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; under section 47(xb) and 47(x) of the Act and as a result, there is no capital gain tax liability at the time of conversion of CCPS and CCDs into equity shares.<br /><br /> Consequently, in both these cases, the cost of shares received upon conversion shall be the cost of CCPS or CCDs respectively (this is as per section 49(2A) of the Act). Further, the period of holding of CCPS and CCDs shall be counted for period of holding of shares (this is as per section 2(42A)/Explanation 1(hf) and Rule 8AA(2)), to determine whether the gains arising on sale of converted shares are long-term or short-term.<br /><br /> The question, thus, arises is as to whether, since the transaction of conversion has been examined (and exempted) under the head &lsquo;capital gains&rsquo;, can it be examined again under section 56(2)(x) of the Act which falls under the head &lsquo;Income from Other Sources&rsquo;? The answer seems to be &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. This is for the reason that the levy of tax under section 56(2)(x) of the Act is not upon any transfer of a capital asset by the assessee but upon a receipt of a specified property which constitutes capital asset of the assessee.<br /><br /> <u>What should be taken as &lsquo;consideration&rsquo; for receiving shares upon conversion:</u><br /><br /> Let us understand the issue by way of an example. An investor invests INR 1000 in unlisted CCPS and is entitled to get the same converted into 10 equity shares of INR 10 each (i.e. at a premium of INR 90 per share) after certain period of time. In this case, the conversion price amounts to INR 100 per share. Further assuming that the Tax FMV of the unlisted CCPS is also INR 1000, there is no tax under section 56(2)(x) at the time of allotment of CCPS.<br /> At a point of time when the CCPS is converted into equity shares, the Tax FMV per equity share is INR 150. The assessee gets 10 equity shares in lieu of one CCPS of INR 1000. The conversion of CCPS into equity shares will not be regarded as &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; of CCPS for capital gain tax purposes, and thus there will not be any levy of capital gain tax on the assessee. Further, the cost of acquisition of 10 equity shares will be deemed to be INR 1000 (i.e. the cost of acquisition of CCPS being INR 1000).<br /><br /> As discussed above, one would need to examine as to whether any income arises to the assessee under section 56(2)(x) of the Act upon receiving 10 equity shares of Rs.10 each. The question is, as to whether this will result in an income of INR 500 under section 56(2)(x) of the Act being the excess of INR 1500 (Tax FMV of 10 equity shares) over INR 1000 (being the cost of acquisition of CCPS)?<br /><br /> In my view, the above is not the correct way of looking at the provisions of section 56(2)(x) of the Act. This is a case where the assessee gets one property (i.e. equity shares) by surrendering another property (i.e. CCPS). Section 56(2)(x) of the Act simply provides that where any person &lsquo;receives&rsquo; shares for a consideration which is less than the Tax FMV of the shares, then, the excess of Tax FMV of the shares over the consideration is taxable as income of the recipient. There is no mandate in section 56(2)(x) of the Act that the consideration discharged means cost of acquisition of the property surrendered.<br /><br /> If a view is taken that the consideration discharged means cost of acquisition of the property surrendered, it will lead to absurd results. Let us understand this point by way of another simple example wherein an individual exchanges his residential house having market value of INR 50 million purchased many years ago at a cost of INR 2 million, with another property having market value equal to INR 50 million. In other words, the individual exchanges INR 50 million worth of property with another property worth INR 50 million, and obviously the individual is not getting any benefit by way of exchange. In other words, he is not getting the property for a consideration at anything less than fair market value. If in this example, the fair market value of property received (i.e. INR 50 million) is compared with the cost of acquisition of property transferred (i.e. INR 2 million), that will result in an absurd situation that the individual will be subjected to tax on income of INR 48 million under section 56(2)(x) of the Act though it is clearly not a case that he acquires the property for a consideration which is less than fair market value.<br /><br /> Now coming back to the original example, when the assessee receives shares of Tax FMV of INR 1500, the consideration given by the assessee should be the market value of CCPS on the date of conversion. Since the CCPS has an inbuilt right of conversion into 10 equity shares of INR 10 each, the market value of the CCPS should mirror the market value of 10 equity shares. Thus, if the fair market value of CCPS is equal to INR 1500, then, while the provisions of section 56(2)(x) of the Act are applicable on receipt of shares, in computation, no income will arise under section 56(2)(x) of the Act.<br /><br /> It is relevant to note here that when we say that that the market value of CCPS should mirror the market value of the equity shares to be received, what is relevant is the actual market value of the said equity shares (and not any derived value which is the case where equity shares are unlisted), and further, the valuer may discount the same a bit given that CCPS are not &lsquo;equity shares&rsquo; and a process is involved in conversion of the same into equity shares.</p>
